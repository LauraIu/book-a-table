Each restaurant offers a chance for people to visit Italy without stamping their passports. Wood-fired ovens are imported from Naples with the cooking surface made of lava stone, directly from the Vesuvius, assuring the authenticity of the pizza. Every aspect of the pizzeria embraces the traditional Neapolitan culture. Decorated with Pulcinella masks, hanging Parma prosciuttos, chillies, flasks, and entire Parmigiano wheels, weâ€™ve created a little slice of Naples."
